# Playwright E2E Test Automation Framework

This project is a comprehensive End-to-End test automation framework built with Playwright and JavaScript. It demonstrates best practices in automation by testing the popular demo e-commerce site, [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com).

## ✨ Features

-   **Page Object Model (POM):** Code is structured using POM for better maintainability, readability, and reusability.
-   **Data-Driven:** User credentials are separated from test code and stored in JSON files.
-   **Cross-Browser Support:** Configured to run on Chromium, easily extendable to Firefox and WebKit.
-   **Parallel Execution:** Tests are configured to run in parallel to reduce execution time.
-   **HTML Reporting:** Generates a detailed HTML report with test results, traces, and screenshots upon failure.
-   **CI/CD Ready:** The framework is self-contained and can be easily integrated into any CI/CD pipeline like GitHub Actions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
